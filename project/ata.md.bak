title: "Hybrid CPU/GPU Memory-Bound Database Primitives"
subtitle: ""
summary: "Because of their high memory-access to compute ratios, memory-bound algorithms such as the linear scan and multiway merge are not considered for acceleration using the GPU. By ignoring computation and considering only data transfers, we developed a model to evenly distribute the work between the CPU and GPU on heteregeneous computing platforms, thus enabling the acceleration of these memory-bound algorithms. We implemented hybrid algorithms to test the effectiveness of our model, resulting in up to 2.5x speedup over CPU-only implementations with low average load imbalance (5-20%) between architectures."
