title: "Utilizing the GPU to Accelerate Response-Based Cryptography Systems."
subtitle: ""
summary: "Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) can provide strong, reliable sources of authentication. Previously, systems utilizing PUFs for authentication required error rates of less than 10%. Errors are time-consuming to resolve on low-powered devices (cell phones and homecomputers), and result in large differences in computed cypertexts. By utilizing high-performance computing clusters, error-tolerance grows and recovering from errors becomes faster. However, these clusters consume massive amounts of power, and by taking advantage of the massive parallelism afforded by the GPU, we may be able to achieve results comparable to those achieved by thousands of CPU cores on a single machine."
