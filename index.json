Understanding the diverse antiviral immune response has important implications for both epidemiology and immunology, but our capacity for characterizing this response has been historically limited due to the low throughput nature of the available assays. To circumvent this limitation, we have developed a highly multiplexed approach for serological characterization that allows for the elucidation of an individual’s full viral exposure history within a single assay. By treating the design of the assay as an instance of the set-cover problem, we were able to achieve similar levels of epitope coverage in 37-54% fewer oligos than existing approaches. By introducing our probes to blood that has been exposed to these viruses, we hope to be able to elucidate an individual's viral exposure history at the species level.","tags":[],"title":"Detection of Viral Exposure History Through Antiviral Antibody Response","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569304875,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569304875,"objectID":"d381ef9dfb6798c1759463eb559f9d60","permalink":"http://zanef.ink/project/ata/","publishdate":"2019-09-23T23:01:15-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/ata/","section":"project","summary":"Because of their high memory-access to compute ratios, memory-bound algorithms such as the linear scan and multi-way merge are not considered for acceleration using the GPU. By ignoring computation and considering only data transfers, we developed a model to evenly distribute the work between the CPU and GPU on heterogeneous computing platforms, thus enabling the acceleration of these memory-bound algorithms. We implemented hybrid algorithms to test the effectiveness of our model, resulting in up to 2.5x speedup over CPU-only implementations with low average load imbalance (5-20%) between architectures.","tags":[],"title":"Hybrid CPU/GPU Memory-Bound Database Primitives","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569304716,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569304716,"objectID":"458fc9b025cc1894afe3074e591ba182","permalink":"http://zanef.ink/project/wolff/","publishdate":"2019-09-23T22:58:36-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/wolff/","section":"project","summary":"A digital divide exists in the United States, where some communities have limited access to the high-bandwidth networks that connect the world.

Previously, systems utilizing PUFs for authentication required error rates of less than 10%. Errors are time-consuming to resolve on low-powered devices (cell phones and home computers), and result in large differences in computed cyphertexts. By utilizing high-performance computing clusters, error-tolerance grows and recovering from errors becomes faster. However, these clusters consume massive amounts of power, and by taking advantage of the massive parallelism afforded by the GPU, we may be able to achieve results comparable to those achieved by thousands of CPU cores on a single machine.","tags":[],"title":"Utilizing the GPU to Accelerate Response-Based Cryptography Systems.","type":"project"},{"authors":["Michael Gowanlock","Ben Karsin","Zane Fink","Jordan Wright"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602197588,"objectID":"ed23c18f12a7be3bb0d60e7fb053a84b","permalink":"http://zanef.ink/publication/gowanlock-2019-accelerating/","publishdate":"2020-10-08T22:53:08.275577Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowanlock-2019-accelerating/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Accelerating the Unacceleratable: Hybrid CPU/GPU Algorithms for Memory-Bound Database Primitives","type":"publication"}]
